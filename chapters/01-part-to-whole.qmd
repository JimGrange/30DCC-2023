I will be honest, I didn't know what was meant by a "part-to-whole" data visualisation, so I did what all the cool kids are doing these days and I asked Chat-GPT:

```{r}
#| code-summary: Code
#| code-fold: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
data <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000), 
  y = rnorm(1000)
)
data
```
